Formerly a private data pack I made just for fun, now grown out to an entire multifunctional datapack. But still revolving around the same guy: Henri.
# Henri's datapack
started out as a joke. This sketchy shady villager who would sell you impossible-to-craft potions. He still does that, but he now also enhances how tamed animals work, he can start a chat with you, is customisable through a settings menu.

## Functions this datapack has
- Animal improving: _(toggleable in [settings](./docs/settings.md))_
  - Super sleep (revitalising sleep)
  - Cat love, making them tell you they love you and revitalise you with their love.
  - Dog pride, making the wolf stronger when near you.
- Auto-spawning, spawning Henri in close to a random online player, on datapack (re)load.  _(toggleable in [settings](./docs/settings.md))_
- Customisable permissions  _(in [settings](./docs/settings.md))_
  - Allowing players to spawn in Henri themselves
  - Allowing players to use Henri-cheats
  - â€¦and more
- [Henri-active](./docs/about/function/active.md)
  - Henri can talk to you, chatting random preprogrammed sentences to nearby users.
  - Henri can do 'oopsies', randomly dropping items or effects.
